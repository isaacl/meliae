Meliae 0.4
##########

:0.4: (not released yet)

* We now only compile against Cython. I've finally hit some issues that
  I don't want to work around. Namely sizeof(Class) doesn't work under
  even pyrex 0.9.9. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Duplicate parent entries are filtered out. (eg the intern dict refers
  to the same string 2x, you'll see 1 parent ref in the child, not 2.)
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* We now default to limiting the maximum length of the parents list
  (default 100). I had some dumps where a single object was referenced
  50k times. Anything over about 10 is at the point where you won't
  really walk them. This can be disabled with ``load(max_parents=-1)``.
  The main win is lowering memory consumption. A 50k parent list takes
  200kB by itself (on 32-bit).  (John Arbash Meinel)

Meliae 0.3
##########

:0.3: 2010-08-02

The main update is the ability to do more queries on a subset of
the object graph. ``om.summarize(starting_at, excluding=[address])``
lets you find out what is more directly "owned" by a given object.

* Add ``__sizeof__`` members to a lot of the core classes (IntSet,
  etc.) (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``ObjectManager.compute_total_size()`` now only computes the size of
  a single object, rather than all objects. All objects took too long
  to be useful anyway, better to make it easier to use the useful api.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``obj.iter_recursive_refs()`` can now be used to find all objects
  referenced from this object (including obj). It can also take an
  iterable of object addresses to exclude. Which makes it easy to ask,
  "What objects are accessible from X that aren't accessible from Y?"
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``ObjectManager.summarize()`` can now take an object and an exclusion
  list, and summarize the referenced objects. This can be quite useful
  when you want to look at just a subset of the graph. The syntax is
  ``ObjectManager.summarize(obj, [not_address1, not_address2])``.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``obj.all()`` and ``obj.compute_total_size()`` helpers. These let you
  get the set of referenced objects matching the type (like
  ``om.get_all()``). But they *also* allow you to pass an exclusion
  list, so you can only get things reachable from here and not
  reachable from there. (John Arbash Meinel)


Meliae 0.2.1
############

:0.2.1: 2010-07-20

* When dumping a ``PyFrame`` look at the function object for
  ``co_name``, so you don't have to wander through the references to
  get their yourself. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Fixes for the simple regex parser (w/o simplejson). However,
  simplejson is still recommended, because it is both faster and more
  accurate (decodes unicode escapes, etc). (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``loader.load()`` now defaults to computing parents and collapsing
  instance dicts. It does mean that loading will be a bit slower, and
  consume more memory, but it is almost always what you need to do
  first anyway. (John Arbash Meinel)


Meliae 0.2.1rc1
###############

:0.2.1rc1: 2010-06-30

* Avoid calling ``PyType_Type.tp_traverse`` when the argument is not a
  heap-class. There is an assert that gets tripped if you are running a
  debug build (or something to do with how Fedora builds its python).
  (John Arbash Meinel, #586122)

* Flush the file handle before exiting. We were doing it at the Python
  layer, but that might not translate into the ``FILE*`` object.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #428165)

* Handle some issues when using Pyrex 0.9.8.4. It was treating
  ``<unsigned long>`` as casting the object pointer, not as a Python
  level "extract an integer". However, assignment to an ``cdef unsigned
  long`` does the right thing. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Tweak some memory performance issues (Gary Poster, #581918)


Meliae 0.2.0
############

:0.2.0: 2010-01-08

A fairly major reworking of the internals, provides significant memory
savings and easier navigation of the object graph.


New Features
************

* The loader internals have been rewritten significantly. Instead of
  storing a bunch of objects in a regular python dict, they are now
  stored in a custom Pyrex collection, and proxy objects are created on
  demand.  This means significantly improved memory usage. (roughly
  2:1). (John Arbash Meinel)

* The internals change also changes the interface a bit. When viewing
  an object, a shorter display is given. One can use ``obj[offset]`` to
  get the object at that reference, rather than the reference itself.
  (so fewer indirections through the ObjManager). (John Arbash Meinel)

* Now supports the ``__sizeof__`` interface introduced in python 2.6.
  This allows a class (especially extension classes) to inform
  Meliae/Python how many bytes it is consuming in memory.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Memory objects now use a ``.children`` and ``.parents`` notation,
  rather than ``.ref_list`` and ``.referrers``. For one, this makes it
  clearer as 'referred to' and 'referred from' is a bit tricky. We also
  now have ``.c`` and ``.p`` which return a list of Memory objects,
  rather than just a list of addresses. This makes it very quick to
  move around. Especially with ``.refs_as_dict`` and other such
  niceties. (John Arbash Meinel)
